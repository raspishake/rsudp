Installation is covered in our |installation_video|.


Installing on Linux & MacOS
*********************************

A UNIX installer script is available at :bash:`unix-install-rsudp.sh`.
This script checks whether or not you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed,
then downloads and installs it if need be.
This script has been tested on both :bash:`x86_64` and :bash:`armv7l`
architectures (meaning that it can run on your home computer or a Raspberry Pi)
and will download the appropriate Anaconda distribution, set up a virtual Python environment,
and leave you ready to run the program. To install using this method, open a Terminal and
enter the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    bash unix-install-rsudp.sh

.. warning::
    In order for this installer to work correctly,
    your Anaconda/Miniconda base directory must be in your home folder,
    for example: :bash:`~/anaconda3` or :bash:`~/miniconda3`.
    If this is not the case, you could end up with a second conda installation overriding your first.

.. note::
    **The installer script will pause partway through to ask if you would like to make the**
    :bash:`conda` **command executable by default.**
    **This is done by appending the line below to your** :bash:`~/.bashrc` **file.**
    This is generally harmless, but if you have a specific objection to it,
    hitting any key other than "y" will cause the script to skip this step.
    You will have to manually run the :bash:`conda` executable in this case, however.
    If you choose to do it manually later, follow the instructions in the section below.

You are now ready to proceed to the next section, :ref:`settings`.


.. _source:

Run the sourcing line
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you are running UNIX and having trouble running ``conda activate``
commands, your operating system probably doesn't know where to look
for Anaconda. To fix this, we need to tell it to read Anaconda's
definitions telling it where to look.

If you are running an x86 (desktop or laptop) or AMD type processor,
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    . $HOME/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

or on ARMv7 (Raspberry Pi) architecture with Raspbian OS:

.. code-block:: bash

    . $HOME/berryconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

where :bash:`$HOME` is the home directory of the current user.

.. note::

    You can run :bash:`uname -m` to check your computer's architecture.


Add the sourcing line to your :py:data:`~/.bashrc`
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The UNIX installer script *should* do this step automatically,
but if you have this problem consistently, you may need to add this
line to your ``~/.bashrc`` file.
The following step will append the sourcing line to
the end of your :bash:`~/.bashrc` is the following (architecture-dependent):

On x86/AMD systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo ". $HOME/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

or on ARMv7:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo ". $HOME/berryconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.bashrc


Updating
---------------------------------

Unix users can update the repository to the latest development version by running the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /rsudp/location
    git pull
    bash unix-install-rsudp.sh

The update script will replace the previous default settings file
(:bash:`~/.config/rsudp/rsudp_settings.json`) with a new settings file.
If you use the default settings file, you will need to copy some old values over to the new file.
The reason for this is that the default settings file may change (i.e. add or modify sections of values)
and thus must be rewritten when updating. On Linux, backed up settings files will be named
:bash:`~/.config/rsudp/rsudp_settings.json.~x~`, where :bash:`x` is an integer.
On Mac, the backed up file will simply be named :bash:`~/.config/rsudp/rsudp_settings.json~`.
To back up the settings file yourself to a location that will not be overwritten,
you can do a command similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    cp ~/.config/rsudp/rsudp_settings.json ~/.config/rsudp/rsudp_settings.json.bak


Installing on Windows
*********************************

The Easy Way
---------------------------------

You can follow these steps to both install and update rsudp.

.. |github_download| raw:: html

   <a href="https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp/archive/refs/heads/master.zip" target="_blank">Download</a>

.. |github_latest| raw:: html

   <a href="https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp/releases/latest/" target="_blank">latest release</a>

.. |github_homepage| raw:: html

   <a href="https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp/" target="_blank">GitHub landing page</a>

1. |github_download| and unzip the software from the |github_latest| in the GitHub repository (also available by clicking Code > Download ZIP from the |github_homepage|).
2. Double click the file named ``win-install-rsudp.bat`` in the unzipped folder. You may need administrator privileges for this step.

The install will take several minutes. When it is done, you will have a new settings file at
``~/.config/rsudp/rsudp_settings.json``. Edit this file to change how rsudp runs.

For explanations of the various settings fields and values, head to :ref:`settings`.


Advanced Users
---------------------------------

1. Download and install Anaconda3 or |miniconda3|.
2. Open an Anaconda Prompt.
3. Execute the following lines of code:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda config --append channels conda-forge
    conda create -n rsudp python=3.12 numpy=2.0.1 future scipy lxml sqlalchemy cryptography
    conda activate rsudp
    pip install rsudp

If you wish to play sounds on Windows, please follow steps 1-8 in |windows_tutorial|
in order to install :code:`ffmpeg` and add it to your system's path variable.


You are now ready to proceed to the next section, :ref:`settings`.
