Welcome to rsudp's documentation.
This program was written to parse and process live UDP data streams from
|raspberryshake| personal seismographs and
Raspberry Boom pressure transducer instruments.
rsudp allows users the options to see their data in real time, create alert parameters,
and be notified in various ways when their instrument detects sudden motion.
It is written in Python and is therefore highly customizable.

| In order to get a feel for what rsudp can do, check out our :ref:`youtube` page.
| If you prefer to read in-depth documentation, follow our written :ref:`tutorial`.
