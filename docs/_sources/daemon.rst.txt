rsudp as a ``systemctl`` daemon
################################################

If you need rsudp to restart every time your Debain/Ubuntu machine boots,
this tutorial will work well for you.
This includes both raspbian (Raspberry Pi) and Ubuntu-like systems.
If you have an OS other than Linux, you will need to look elsewhere for
documentation regarding the creation and activation of daemon programs.


Setup instructions
=====================

First of all, clone rsudp to ``~/bin/rsudp``:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/bin
    cd ~/bin
    git clone https://github.com/raspishake/rsudp

If you have not already done so, install rsudp using the provided
installer script.

.. code-block:: bash

    bash ~/bin/rsudp/unix-install-rsudp.sh

Next, enter the following commands in order to set up a user systemd
directory structure.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/default.target.wants

Now create a new service file

.. code-block:: bash

    nano /home/pi/.config/systemd/user/rsudp.service

and paste the following code in it::

    [Unit]
    Description=rsudp daemon
    Documentation=https://github.com/iannesbitt/rsudp
    After=graphical.target

    [Service]
    ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 10
    ExecStart=/bin/bash /home/pi/bin/rsudp/unix-start-rsudp.sh
    ExecStop=kill $MAINPID
    ExecReload=kill $MAINPID; /bin/bash /home/pi/bin/rsudp/unix-start-rsudp.sh
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10s

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target

Next, execute the following lines:

.. code-block:: bash

    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
    systemctl --user start rsudp.service

rsudp should start within about 30 seconds.
You can monitor the program's output in real time by entering the following command
(source function: :func:`rsudp.entry_points.ep_tailf_log`):

.. code-block:: bash

    rs-tailf

Which is the equivalent of ``tail -f /tmp/rsudp/rsudp.log`` on Linux/MacOS
and ``Get-Content -Path "C:/tmp/rsudp/rsudp.log" -Wait`` on Windows.

If it does start correctly, you can enable the daemon to run permanently with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    systemctl --user enable rsudp.service

You can test its enablement by restarting the entire system:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo reboot

Restarting the daemon
==================================

Finally, if you need to restart the rsudp daemon service
(this may be necessary if your Shake changes IP or the network connection
is interrupted, or if rsudp freezes for some reason): 

.. code-block:: bash

    systemctl --user restart rsudp.service


Troubleshooting the daemon
=================================

If rsudp fails to start, you can run ``tail -n 30 -f /tmp/rsudp/rsudp.log``
to see what the error might be, or ``systemctl --user status rsudp.service``
to check whether the service file is misconfigured somehow.

A running daemon will show its status with green text saying "active (running)",
whereas a failed start will show red or grey text that will say
something like "inactive (failed)" or "inactive (dead)"
and will have some diagnostic text with which you can troubleshoot.
