Testing and demoing rsudp
#################################################

rsudp includes a small piece of software meant to test the
ability to function and process seismic data.
This could be useful if you are looking to demonstrate rsudp's
functionality to someone, perhaps a classroom of students,
or if you need to test the core functionality like alerts
and sounds.

Testing can also be useful for discovering whether or not a specific
piece of data will trigger the alarm using settings from a custom
settings file. For instructions on how to do that, see
:ref:`test_settings` and :ref:`custom_data` below.

.. note::

    The testing functions are useful for figuring out local problems.
    That is, the testing capabilities of rsudp are meant to discover
    whether or not the software can feed data to `itself` and
    process it.

    If you can run this testing program without any problems
    but you are having issues getting the software to see data from
    your own Raspberry Shake or boom, see the :ref:`troubleshooting`
    page.


Using the testing functionality
=================================================

The testing modules of this software are designed to read a small
data file from disk and send its contents to the test port one
line at a time. The program functions essentially as it would if
it were receiving remote data, but instead it is feeding data
to itself.

This means that you can demo the software even if you don't have
a Raspberry Shake, or even use the testing functionality to check
whether or not an arbitrary piece of archival Raspberry Shake
data will trigger an alarm in the software.

To run this software, make sure you have installed this software
using the instructions in :ref:`install`, and that you can enter
your conda environment (see :ref:`run-test`).

Once you have done that, the test command ``rs-test`` will become
available.

Type ``rs-test`` to watch earthquake detection in
action. The test will last about 120 seconds, over which time
various bits of functionality will be tested, including ports,
directory permissions, internet, processing routines,
alert functionality, sound-playing capability, and more.

It does test whether it can see the internet at large,
and whether it can send data to its own port
(we've chosen 18888 as a test port).
However, it does not test the ability to receive data from a
remote shake. If you are having trouble with that, please see the
:ref:`troubleshooting` page.


.. _test_settings:

Settings during testing
=================================================

Default settings are slightly different during testing than they would
ordinarily be. Find a summary of what gets changed at
:py:func:`rsudp.test.make_test_settings`.

To specify a settings file to use, use the ``-s`` flag. This is the same
as it would be if you were telling the ``rs-client`` to start with a
specific settings file. Usage looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    rs-test -s custom_settings.json

.. note::

    If you need to dump and edit a custom settings file to test with, you can
    use the client's settings dump:

    .. code-block:: bash

        rs-client -d custom_settings.json


.. _testing_flow:

Data flow during testing
=================================================

During testing, the typical data flow as depicted in
:ref:`flow` must be created artificially.
So, instead of getting data from the Raspberry Shake as usual,
the :py:class:`rsudp.t_testdata.TestData` thread reads a file and
sends the individual lines in that file to the data port.
The Producer then reads that data and data flow through the rest
of the architecture continues as normal.

.. figure::  _static/test-flow.png
    :align:   center

    based on the :ref:`flow` diagram, showing how data
    makes its way through the program during testing.
    Note that there is no Raspberry Shake in the hierarchy
    as there would be in ordinary operation, but instead
    data is generated from a text file at
    ``rsudp/test/testdata``.


Testing your own modules
=================================================

Read about adding testing capabilities to new modules in
:ref:`add_testing`.


.. _custom_data:

Using your own data
=================================================

.. |canread| raw:: html

   <a href="https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.read.html#supported-formats" target="_blank">can read</a>


Included in this software is a function that will convert
small seismic data files (basically anything that obspy |canread|
that was recorded at the same sample rate as the Raspberry Shake)
to the UDP packet format required by rsudp.

This function is documented at :py:func:`rsudp.packetize.packetize`
and it is integrated into the testing script. You can tell the testing
script to convert and use a miniSEED file on disk by doing the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    rs-test -f test.mseed

This will create a text file named ``test.mseed.txt`` in the same directory
which will be used to feed data to the producer during testing.
