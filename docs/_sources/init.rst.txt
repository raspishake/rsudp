:py:data:`rsudp.__init__` (initialization functions)
=====================================================

These are the initialization functions in rsudp.
The useful things here are likely ``printM``, ``printW`` and ``printE``
which interface with the logging utility to print messages, warnings,
and errors in color and save them to the logs.
